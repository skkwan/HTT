# Week 3

## Friday June 28, 2019

- `ll -hSr` shows size of files which is helpful for a quick glance at whether files have completed.
- `cd /hdfs/store/user/skkwan` to view resulting ROOT files (it's long-term storage so it is slower)
- All branches with `sv` are from the FastMTT/svFit process.
- `eventTree->Scan("m_sv_ClusteredMet_UP:m_sv")` to view multilebranches.


To-do:
* Do FastMTT on the missing samples: check against submit_fastMTT.shscript.
* '/hdfs/store/user/shigginb/2019_June_18_2016_tt/'
